# HMAC-arduino-uno
Apply HMAC to arduino uno

This example was taken from https://github.com/Cathedrow/Cryptosuite/blob/master/Sha/examples/hmacsha256test/hmacsha256test.pde
SHA256 Libraries are taken from https://github.com/simonratner/Arduino-SHA-256 
To get the example working, added Sha256 sha and replace all Sha256 call to sha call. Thanks to the help from
